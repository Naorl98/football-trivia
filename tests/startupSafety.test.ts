  WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR

  Two release blockers, both reproduced against production before anything was
  changed, both of which presented as a completely white page that stayed white:

  1. STALE DEPLOY. A browser holding a previous deployment's index.html asked for
     a bundle hash that no longer existed. The SPA fallback answered 200 OK with
     index.html, Content-Type text/html, and the browser refused it:

       "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script
        but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME
        type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec."

     React never mounted and #root stayed empty. The stale stylesheet was missing
     too, so there was no background either — hence "completely white".

  2. PERSISTED STATE. Reads of sessionStorage were neither guarded nor validated.
     With storage access refused (Safari, "Block all cookies") the accessor threw
     inside render; with a stale or corrupt value, `JSON.parse(raw) as T` parsed
     fine and threw one property access later. React 19 unmounts the entire root
     when a render throws, so both ended in the same blank page. Seven of nine
     junk payloads took out /play or /results.

  The shape of the fix is tested here; the end-to-end behaviour is driven by
  scripts/reliability-qa.mjs against a real browser, and the HTTP surface by
  scripts/security-qa.mjs against a real deployment.
