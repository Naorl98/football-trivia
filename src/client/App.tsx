        THE CHROME IS OPTIONAL; THE ROUTE IS NOT.

        Everything outside <main> is furniture — scroll restoration, a live
        region for screen readers, the header, the footer, the consent bar. Each
        is wrapped on its own so that a failure in one costs exactly that one.
        Before this, any of them could throw from an effect after first paint
        and unmount the whole root, which is what produced a fully rendered page
        that emptied itself a second later.

        The <Routes> below are deliberately NOT wrapped like this. If the quiz
        board fails, rendering nothing would be the blank page this is all about;
        that belongs to the root ErrorBoundary in main.tsx, which says something
        and offers a way out.
