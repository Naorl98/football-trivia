// Startup.
//
// Short, and every line of it is about not failing. The old version was three
// statements with a non-null assertion on `getElementById`, which meant any
// throw between here and the first paint produced a blank page with nothing on
// it — see index.html for the two mechanisms that actually did that in
// production.
//
// The order below is load-bearing:
//
//   1. the error boundary is the OUTERMOST element, outside BrowserRouter and
//      outside App. A boundary inside the router cannot catch the router
//      throwing, and a bad history entry or a malformed URL is one of the things
//      worth catching.
//   2. the boot layer is told we mounted only after render() has returned, so
//      "mounted" means React genuinely put something on screen rather than
//      "the bundle evaluated".
//   3. nothing optional runs before render. Accessibility settings and the audio
//      context are armed from an effect inside App, so neither can keep the
//      first paint from happening.
//
// global.css must be imported BEFORE App.
//
// Vite emits CSS in module-graph order, so importing App first put every
// component stylesheet ahead of the base layer — and any rule that tied on
// specificity with a global one (`.stamp` vs `.fixture-tag`, say) silently lost
// to the global. Base first, components after, is the order everything else
// here assumes.

    Dismisses the loading shell and cancels the nine-second failsafe.

    Deferred by one frame on purpose, so a synchronous throw out of the initial
    render is still caught by the failsafe rather than being hidden behind a
    shell we had already taken down.

    BUT NOT BY requestAnimationFrame ALONE, which is what this used to be and
    was a real bug: rAF does not fire while a page is not visible. A link opened
    in a background tab, an in-app browser that pre-warms the page off-screen, or
    a visitor who switches away during load all produce the same result — React
    renders fine, the callback never runs, and the opaque boot shell sits on top
    of a perfectly good app. Reproduced on both engines: "headline is COVERED,
    curtain z9999 rgb(13,21,34)", which is this shell, over a rendered page.

    So: whichever of the frame and the timer arrives first wins, and the timer
    does not care about visibility. `handed` makes it once-only. The boot layer
    also dismisses itself on seeing #root populated, so this handshake is now a
    convenience rather than the only way out.
