// The builder's model: one screen, five rows, and a rule about what may appear.
//
// THE THIRD SHAPE THIS HAS TAKEN, and the reason is worth stating once.
//
//   1. everything on one scrolling page — sixty tap targets, no idea what you
//      were deciding
//   2. an eight-step wizard — one decision per screen, which fixed the wall and
//      replaced it with a form you had to fill in before you could play
//   3. this: one compact screen, every default already valid, Start reachable
//      without touching anything
//
// Step 2 was not wrong about density; it was wrong about CEREMONY. A quiz
// builder is not a settings page, and a player who wants a game should not have
// to answer four questions to get one. So the steps collapse into rows of
// segmented controls, the defaults are a real game, and everything beyond that
// is optional.
//
// THE OTHER HALF IS WHAT IS NOT SHOWN. An option that cannot fill the quiz the
// player asked for is not offered at all — not greyed out, not annotated,
// absent. The previous build disabled such options and explained why, which is
// honest and still wrong: it turns the screen into a list of things you cannot
// have. Hiding them means every visible choice leads to a game, which is what
// makes a dead end impossible rather than merely unlikely.
