// The API client.
//
// Three things it has to get right, none of which it used to:
//
// TIMEOUTS. `fetch` has none. A request that is answered by nothing — the case
// on a phone that has lost its connection without the OS noticing yet — never
// settles, so the promise never rejects and whatever is awaiting it waits
// forever. That is the stuck spinner.
//
// But an aggressive timeout is its own bug. A cold Worker doing a scoped
// question query over a 15,000-row bank, from a phone on a weak cellular link,
// is legitimately slow, and cancelling that at three seconds turns a working
// request into a failure the visitor is told about. So the values below are
// generous and differ per operation, and they are documented here rather than
// scattered as magic numbers:
//
//   read, cheap      8s   counts and room summaries: one indexed query
//   read, expensive 15s   quiz generation, daily, challenge replay
//   write           15s   attempts and challenge creation
//
// RETRIES, AND ONLY WHERE THEY ARE SAFE. A GET or an idempotent read is retried
// on a transport failure or a 5xx; a POST that changes state is NOT, ever, even
// on a timeout — a timed-out attempt submission may well have been applied, and
// retrying it writes a second row. The one apparent exception is `/api/quiz`,
// which is a POST only because its filter does not fit in a query string: it
// creates nothing and is safe to repeat. That is marked explicitly at the call
// site rather than inferred from the method.
//
// 4xx is never retried. A 400 means the request was wrong and will be wrong
// again; a 429 means slow down, and retrying is the opposite of that.
//
// WHAT THE CALLER GETS. An `ApiError` carrying a kind, so a page can tell
// "offline" from "the server said no" from "this took too long" and say
// something true. The old client threw `new Error("Request failed")` for all
// three, which is where a vague "the server stopped responding" comes from: the
// client could not tell the difference and guessed the worst one.
