// Player names.
//
// A name typed by one player is rendered on every other player's screen, so it
// is the one piece of attacker-controlled text in the whole multiplayer surface.
// React escapes it on output, but relying on that alone would mean the name is
// only safe as long as nobody ever puts it in a title attribute, an aria-label,
// a QR payload or a D1 row — so it is cleaned once, at the door, and stored
// clean.
//
// What gets removed, and why:
//   * C0/C1 control characters and zero-width marks — invisible, and a
//     zero-width joiner lets two different names render identically
//   * bidi overrides and isolates — in an RTL product these can reorder the text
//     around them, so a name could visually escape its own row and rewrite the
//     scoreboard next to it
//   * angle brackets and ampersands — defence in depth for any future sink that
//     is not JSX
//   * runs of whitespace, collapsed to one space
//
// What is deliberately KEPT: Hebrew geresh/gershayim, apostrophes and hyphens.
// They are ordinary parts of real names, and stripping them would make the
// product feel like it does not expect Hebrew speakers.
