// The room state machine.
//
// This is where every multiplayer rule actually lives: who may answer, when a
// round closes, what an answer is worth, who is host, what happens when someone
// drops. It is deliberately NOT a Durable Object — it is a plain class with an
// injected clock that knows nothing about WebSockets, storage or D1.
//
// Two things fall out of that:
//
//   * The Durable Object shrinks to plumbing: sockets in, effects out, state
//     persisted. There is no game logic inside it to get wrong twice.
//   * Every rule is unit-testable in Node, at speed, without a Workers runtime.
//     A three-player turn-based game with a mid-round disconnect is a dozen
//     lines of test rather than a browser harness.
//
// The engine never reaches for `Date.now()`. Time arrives as a parameter on
// every entry point, which is what makes "the answer window expired" and "the
// grace period ran out" testable at all.
//
// ASYNC IS PUSHED OUT. Loading questions from D1 is the only asynchronous thing
// a room does, so it happens in the caller: `requestStart` validates and reports
// what to fetch, and `beginGame` is handed the fetched questions. The engine
// itself has no promises in it.
