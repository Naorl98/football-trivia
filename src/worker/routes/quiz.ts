/**
 * Per-option availability for the wizard's current step.
 *
 * The builder shows a real number beside every choice and disables the ones that
 * cannot fill the requested quiz, which is the difference between a step that
 * looks rich and a step that IS useful: "ישראל — 55 שאלות" tells a player
 * something true that no amount of card styling can.
 *
 * `dimensions` is what keeps it affordable. A step asks for the one dimension it
 * renders, each dimension is one GROUP BY rather than one COUNT per option, and
 * the answer caches at the edge exactly like /count — the bank moves when a seed
 * is applied, not while somebody is choosing filters. See db/availability.ts for
 * the measurement that made the GROUP BY necessary.
