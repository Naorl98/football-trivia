 * THIS IS THE ENUMERATION SURFACE. Six digits is a million codes, the answer is
 * a clean 200-or-404, and there is nothing secret about a room beyond its code —
 * so with no limit, walking the space finds every live room in the product in
 * minutes. Three things make that unattractive, and none of them is enough
 * alone:
 *
 *   * the lookup is metered per client address, which turns minutes into years
 *   * a malformed code is answered with the same 404 as a well-formed absent
 *     one, on the same path and after the same work, so neither the status nor
 *     the shape of the response distinguishes "not a code" from "no such room"
 *   * rooms are short-lived by construction (empty rooms are swept after ten
 *     minutes, idle ones after two hours), so a harvested list goes stale
 *
 * What is NOT claimed: a code is not a secret and never was. Anyone who has it
 * can join, which is the whole design — it is read aloud across a room. The
 * limit is about making the space expensive to sweep, not about making a single
 * code unguessable.
