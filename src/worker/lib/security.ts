// Response headers and the Content-Security-Policy.
//
// WHY THIS IS A WORKER CONCERN AND NOT A STATIC FILE. Cloudflare's assets
// binding serves files with no security headers and no say in their cache
// policy, so the only place that can set either is Worker code sitting in front
// of it. That is also why `run_worker_first` is on: an asset that bypasses the
// Worker bypasses everything in this file.
//
// THE CSP IS BUILT PER REQUEST, for one reason: `connect-src`. The multiplayer
// socket is `wss://<this host>/api/mp/...`, and the host differs between
// football-iq.naorl.workers.dev, a preview deployment and localhost. Hard-coding
// it would either break the socket off the production hostname or force a
// wildcard. Deriving it from the request costs a string concat and keeps the
// directive exact.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT LOCKED DOWN, and why, so the next person does not
// "fix" it:
//
//   style-src 'unsafe-inline'   React writes inline style attributes (eighteen
//                               components use `style={{…}}`, and the
//                               accessibility text-scale is a custom property
//                               set on <html>). Blocking those means blocking
//                               the product. An inline style attribute is not a
//                               script execution path, and with no HTML sink
//                               anywhere in the app (see SECURITY.md) it is not
//                               a route to one either.
//
//   fonts.googleapis.com        global.css opens with an @import for Rubik and
//   fonts.gstatic.com           Assistant. The stylesheet request is made BY the
//                               bundled CSS, so it is style-src, and the font
//                               files themselves are font-src.
//
// Everything else is closed: no 'unsafe-eval', no wildcards, no inline script
// except the one bootstrap block, which carries a per-response nonce.
