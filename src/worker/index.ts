 * Worker logs the same value — so a failure on a device can be looked up in the
 * Worker's own record of that exact request.
 *
 * WHAT IS LOGGED: the id, method, pathname, status and duration. Not the query

 * records what a visitor was doing is not one worth having. Only errors and slow
 * requests are logged; logging every asset hit would bury them.

  /**
   * A FAILURE ON AN ASSET MUST NOT BE A BLANK PAGE.

   * This branch is new, and it closes a hole that routing assets through the
   * Worker opened. Before `run_worker_first`, a request for the JS bundle was
   * answered by the asset layer and could not be affected by Worker code at
   * all; now every asset request runs this file first, so a bug or a resource
   * limit in here becomes a failed bundle — which is a blank page, the exact
   * failure this whole effort is about. Trading a header policy for a new way
   * to lose the app would be a bad bargain.
   *
   * So: if the Worker itself fails while serving the shell, answer with a
   * standalone document that says so and offers a reload. It depends on no
   * bundle, no stylesheet and no JavaScript, and it carries the same background
   * colour as the app, so the worst case is a dark page with a sentence on it
   * rather than a white one with nothing.
   *
   * A hashed asset still gets a plain error: a stylesheet or a script cannot
   * usefully be replaced with prose, and index.html's boot layer is watching for
   * a script that fails to load.

/**
 * Static assets, served by the Worker rather than past it.
 *
 * THIS FUNCTION IS THE BLANK-SCREEN FIX. The mechanism it closes, which was
 * reproduced against production before it was written:
 *
 *   1. a visitor holds index.html from deployment N (a restored iOS tab, a
 *      back/forward entry, an edge or browser cache that had not revalidated)
 *   2. that HTML asks for /assets/index-<hash N>.js
 *   3. deployment N+1 deleted that file, because the hash changed
 *   4. `not_found_handling: single-page-application` answered the missing file
 *      with 200 OK and index.html, Content-Type text/html
 *   5. the browser refuses it — "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but
 *      the server responded with a MIME type of text/html. Strict MIME type
 *      checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec."
 *   6. React never mounts. #root stays empty. The stale CSS is missing too, so
 *      the page is not merely empty, it is white.
 *
 * Nothing in that chain produces an error the app can catch, which is why it
 * sat there indefinitely until the visitor happened to reload.
 *
 * So: a request under /assets/ that does not match a file gets a real 404. The
 * browser then fires an `error` event on the script element, which index.html's
 * bootstrap listens for and turns into a one-shot reload onto the current
 * shell — the recovery that used to require the visitor to think of it.
 *
 * SPA fallback still exists, for its actual purpose: /daily and /room/482731 are
 * client-side routes with no file behind them and must return the shell.
