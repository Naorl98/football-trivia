// The random-duel matchmaking queue.
//
// One Durable Object holds the whole queue. That is the point: a single-threaded
// object cannot double-book a player, so "no player is matched twice" and "no
// pair is formed twice" are properties of the runtime rather than of a lock we
// have to get right. Ten players arriving at once are processed one at a time, in
// arrival order, and the odd one out is simply still in the queue afterwards.
//
// THE QUEUE IS THE SOCKETS. There is no stored list of waiting players. A player
// is in the queue if and only if they have an accepted WebSocket whose attachment
// says SEARCHING, and `ctx.getWebSockets()` only returns live sockets — so a
// closed tab leaves the queue by construction and there is no such thing as a
// stale entry to garbage-collect. Attachments survive hibernation, so this holds
// across an eviction too.
//
// A half-dead socket (network gone, no close frame) is a different problem, and is
// handled by the heartbeat: every waiting player is sent a status message every
// couple of seconds, and a send that throws removes them. The heartbeat doubles as
// the rotating "מחפש יריב…" copy, so the liveness check is also the feature.
