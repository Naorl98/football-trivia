// One Durable Object per live multiplayer room, addressed by its room code.
//
// The object is the only authority in the system. It owns the question set, the
// clock, the scores and the turn, and it is the only thing that decides whether
// an answer counted. Clients are renderers: they are told what phase they are in
// and what to draw, and the worst a tampered client can do is send a message
// that gets rejected.
//
// This file is deliberately thin. All the rules live in RoomEngine (shared, pure,
// unit-tested); everything here is plumbing:
//
//   sockets      accept, attach identity, broadcast, drop
//   persistence  the engine's state in Durable Object storage
//   scheduling   one alarm, always set to the engine's next wake time
//   questions    the one async dependency, fetched from D1 and handed in
//   history      a single pair of D1 writes when a game finishes
//
// WHY HIBERNATION. `acceptWebSocket` rather than `accept` means the runtime may
// evict this object from memory between messages while the sockets stay open. A
// lobby of six people waiting for a seventh therefore costs nothing while it
// waits. The cost of that is that in-memory state cannot be trusted across
// messages, which is why the engine is rehydrated from storage on every entry
// point and each socket carries its own identity in its attachment.
